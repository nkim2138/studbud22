## **A2 FEEDBACK**

Regarding the previous assessment, I received feedback from my tutor on my design to improve the user experience:
>_“Perhaps however the 'add task' button should be somewhere near the top? This could be easier to find, especially if the task lists are very long."_

Therefore, before implementing the high-fidelity mockup designs to the web app prototype, I decided to change these features in the mockup to see what it looks like and asked a user to test some of the interactions for further iteration if needed to ensure the navigation was seamless

## **FUNCTIONALITIES**
### 1. TASK LIST + KANBAN BOARD
I firstly created the functionalities for the kanban board where users could create and delete tasks. This was done through HTML and tasklist.js, through the help of week 5-9 tutorials.

Task list functionality was through storing the input of the user with an ID. After that I worked on the styling of the tasks and kanban board so I could have a better look of how it can be draggable across the columns.

### 2. POMODORO TIMER + STOPWATCH
I watched a few youtube tutorials on building pomodoro timers and stopwatch to have a better understanding of where to start, which was really helpful. I put the resources in my references.

Firstly, I started with creating the html elements including the time and the buttons and worked on the styling before adding the functionality so I could better look at the screen. I found it difficult to make the screen switch from pomodoro to stopwatch and vice-versa.



### 3. MUSIC PLAYER


## **RESPONSIVE WEB APP**

## **STYLING**
Styling the web app in CSS was the last thing that I had to do. I did start with setting the typography and colours for fonts... throughout the whole process so I could visualise what I was doing and not get lost

## **FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS**
There are some improvements of the web app that could be made:
#### STYLING
For the future, I would work more on the styling of my web app to look more similar to the mockups I created in the previous assignment.

#### HTML, CSS & JS
- I should refrain from using break tags in future projects
- The use of CSS grid for this assignment would have been very useful to improve the responsiveness of the web app and but I did not use it. The code could have been neater as well and have a clearer structure.
- As coding is not my strongest suit, I still have yet to learn a lot more about Javascript. Watching videos was helpful but I still found it hard to try to complete the functionalities on my own. To improve, I would have to practice further.


#### FUNCTIONALITY
In terms of functionality, there are many more things to change and add. To improve even further with the overall user experience, I would add a popup asking if the user was sure they would want to cancel what they were creating (i.e. new task, material...). Secondly, although the column titles are editable, it does not suggest so to the user. It may come off as a surprise if they select by mistake. Therefore, I would add an edit button beside the title so the user could either select it or delete it. Thirdly, it would be great for the future if the stopwatch, pomodoro timer and music player doesn't stop from carrying the tasks while navigating across different pages.


## **REFLECTION**
This assignment was really challenging but it was satisfying to see the end result.
